This is project comparing health risks to age and income. My observations can be seen on the webpage. For your convenience, I have included them here as well. 

The percentage of obese citizens in a state is slightly correlated with the percentage of citizens in poverty. One explanation could be the cost of healty food compared to unhealthy food like fast food. Obesity seems to be most prevalent amongst middle aged citizens. Finally, there is a slight negativve correlation between obesity and median household income.

There is a slight positive correlation between the percentage of smokers and the percentage of citizens in poverty. The median age for smokers does not vary much based on the state one resides in. Smoking is most prevalent amongst middle-aged citizens. Finally, there is a negative correlation between the percentage of citizens who smoke and the median household income.

There is a positive correlation between citizens who lack healthcare and citizens in poverty. Most citizens in poverty are unemployed. Most citizens have health insurance through their employer. A citizen in poverty is almost certainly an employed. If they are employed, the employer most likely does not provide health insurance. Therefore, the individual does not have access to private health insurancce and adequate healthcare.
